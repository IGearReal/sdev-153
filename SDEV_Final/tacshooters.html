                <h2>Tac Shooters</h2>
                <p>Tactical shooters (often shortened to "tac shooters") are a subgenre of shooter
                    video games that emphasize strategy, teamwork, and realism over the fast-paced,
                    run-and-gun chaos of traditional shooters like DOOM or Call of Duty's arcade modes.
                    Rooted in military simulation, tac shooters demand careful planning, precise execution,
                    and situational awareness, often rewarding players for coordination and patience
                    rather than sheer reflexes. They strike a balance between accessibility and
                    complexity, appealing to those who crave methodical combat over
                    twitch-based heroics.

                </ul>
                <p> Although, there are a lot of Tac shooter games out there we here at LetsTalkGames
                    have picked out two stand
                    outs in the genre to review.
                    We believe you guys the reader would love to know more about these
                    two games as they are loved in the genre.</p>
                <h3>1. Rainbow Six Seige</h3> <img class="img" src="./images/Tom_Clancy's_Rainbow_Six_Siege_cover_art.jpg" alt="Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Seige cover art">
                <p>Siege nails the tactical shooter vibe. Gunplay is crisp and lethal—low time-to-kill
                    means a headshot drops you instantly, rewarding aim and punishing carelessness.
                    Every round is a tension-soaked puzzle: attackers breach walls with thermite
                    charges or sledgehammers, while defenders fortify with reinforced steel or
                    electrified wire. The destructible environments—walls, floors, even ceilings—turn
                    maps into dynamic battlegrounds where no plan survives contact intact. Hearing a muffled explosion above you, followed by a rappelling enemy, is peak adrenaline.
                    The Operator system is a stroke of genius. From Ash’s breaching rounds to Kapkan’s
                    tripwire traps, each character brings a distinct flavor, forcing teams to
                    mix roles—entry fraggers, support, intel gatherers—into a cohesive strategy.
                    With over 70 Operators by 2025 (thanks to years of seasonal updates),
                    the variety keeps matches fresh, though balancing them all is a tightrope Ubisoft
                    mostly walks. Caveats, Siege isn’t flawless. The grind can feel
                    punishing—unlocking Operators takes ages without real-money boosts,
                    and newbies face a wall of veterans who’ve memorized every peek and pixel.
                    The meta shifts with each patch, sometimes leaving fan-favorite Operators
                    nerfed into obscurity (RIP pre-rework Tachanka). Balancing a roster this big is
                    a nightmare—some gadgets feel gimmicky or OP, and power creep sneaks in.

                <h3>2. Counter Strike 2</h3> <img class="img" src="./images/1696414021417.webp" alt="Counter Strike 2 cover art">
                <p> Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), released by Valve in 2023, is a free-to-play tactical shooter
                    where two teams of five—Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists—battle over objectives
                    like planting or defusing a bomb in tense, precise rounds. Built on the Source 2 engine,
                    it’s a modern overhaul of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, offering updated visuals
                    and gameplay tweaks for a new era. The game looks sharp with detailed maps and dynamic
                    smoke grenades that you can shoot through, making every match feel cinematic and
                    strategic. Gunplay is tight and rewarding—land a headshot, and you’ll feel like
                    a pro, while the team-based action shines when you pull off a win with a
                    smart plan. It’s brutal for beginners, with no real tutorial and a community
                    of veterans who’ll crush you until you learn the ropes. Cheaters still pop
                    up despite fixes, and the lack of fun side modes or a story leaves it
                    feeling bare if you’re not into competitive play. 
                </p>
