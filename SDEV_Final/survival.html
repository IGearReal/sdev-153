                    <h2>Survival Games</h2>
                    <p>Survival games are a video game genre where the core focus is on staying alive
                        in challenging, often hostile environments. These games thrust players
                        into scenarios where resource management, adaptability,
                        and perseverance are key to overcoming threats like starvation,
                        exposure, predators, or other players. Rooted in the primal instinct to endure,
                        survival games blend exploration, crafting, and strategy,
                        often with a heavy dose of tension and unpredictability.
                        They’ve surged in popularity over the last decade,
                        thanks to titles that emphasize player agency and emergent storytelling.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Although, there are a lot of survival games out there we here at LetsTalkGames

                       two games as they are loved in the genre.

                    <h3>1. Minecraft</h3> <img class="img" src="./images/MV5BNjQzMDlkNDctYmE3Yi00ZWFiLTlmOWYtMjI4MzQ4Y2JhZjY2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="Minecraft cover art">
                    <p> Minecraft’s genius lies in its simplicity and freedom.
                        The survival loop hooks you fast: day one,
                        you’re scrambling to punch a tree and avoid zombies; by day ten,
                        you’re farming, mining, and plotting a Nether trip.
                        Resource management is intuitive—wood, stone, iron,
                        food—and the crafting system, while basic at first,
                        scales into a rewarding progression of tools, armor,
                        and redstone contraptions. Combat is clunky but functional,
                        with iconic foes like skeletons, creepers,
                        and the Ender Dragon giving you something to fight for. But,
                        Minecraft isn’t flawless. The survival endgame drags—once you’ve beaten
                        the Ender Dragon and decked out in Netherite,
                        the loop can stall unless you set your own goals.
                        Combat remains rudimentary; even with updates like 1.9’s
                        attack cooldown, it lacks the depth of, say, Dark Souls or Terraria.
                        The base game’s progression feels shallow compared to
                        modded experiences, and tutorials are nonexistent—newbies
                        might flounder without a YouTube guide.
                    </p>
                    <p>For anyone looking to buy Minecraft you can find it on the Xbox or Playstation games stores. For
                        those of you on pc you can buy it here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PGW18NPBZV5">Minecraft</a></p>
    
                    <h3>2. Valheim</h3> <img class="img" src="./images/Valheim-Logo-1.jpg" alt="Valheim cover art">
                    <p>Valheim hooks you with its punishing yet fair survival loop.
                         You start with nothing—punch a tree, dodge boars, pray the rain doesn’t
                        kill you—and claw your way up through tiers of progression: stone,
                        bronze, iron, and beyond. Resource gathering feels weighty;
                        chopping trees or mining ore has a tactile rhythm, and every upgrade—like
                        swapping a flint axe for an iron one—feels earned. The crafting system shines,
                        letting you build everything from humble shacks to sprawling longhouses with 
                        functional hearths and cozy beds. Downsides, Valheim falters in its pacing and polish.
                        The mid-to-late game grind—mining black metal or hauling silver down mountains—can
                        drag, especially solo, where carting resources without portals feels like busywork.
                        Progression halts after Yagluth; the unfinished biomes (Deep North, Ashlands) and
                        lack of a true endgame leave you adrift once the bosses are down. For a survival
                        game, it’s light on narrative—beyond the loose Odin framing, there’s little story
                        to latch onto, which might disappoint players craving depth over emergent tales.
                    </p>
                    <p>For anyone looking to buy Valheim you can find it on the Xbox or Playstation games stores. For
